Real Data

To understand the indel dynamics in real data (protein alignments) this study used the 13 bacterial sequence alignments provided by Emmanuelle Lerat, Vincent Daubin and Nancy A. Moran, which they inferred using CLUSTALW 1.8 for their study [13] about the reconstruction of organismal phylogeny. An initial analysis is carried out with four protein alignments (Prot atpB, Prot bioB, Prot gyrA and Prot rpoA) out of 205 protein alignments mentioned in their paper [13]. Even though these protein alignments were generated using CLUSTALW 1.8 program [3] this study consider the MSAs from PRANK v.170427 as the ’true’/reference alignment due to its exceptionally accurate results in previous studies [15] and also due to insufficient information about these protein alignments. Moreover, the tree topologies corresponds to these 4 protein alignments with 13 taxa is inferred using PRANK v.170427 using its −treeonly option. More details of other protein alignments can be viewed in [5].
