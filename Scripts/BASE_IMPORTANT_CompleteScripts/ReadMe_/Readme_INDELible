Steps:
1. Use INDELible_params_all.R file to generate control.txt. Note:- This control file uses different trees for different iteraltions. The simulated data from PIP consist of tree(different for each iteration), TRUE MSA.

2. Use the control.txt file to generate TRUE MSA using INDELible.out (binary file of the INDELible simulator). Note:- The tree will be same as that of (shorttree variable name in R file mentioned above) PIP simulated tree.

3. Copy all TRUE MSA files generated by control.txt file to the directory where preprocess_INDELible_MSA.m is located or include the path in the mat file. In the latter case make sure the file names are calling in order (Note:- mixed sort issue)

4. Now the mat file mentioned in step 3 will generate fasta files i. is Gapped and ii. Ungapped in seperate folders in the same directory. 

5. Since we are not sure what are the values of ⋋ & μ we generate it using ProPIP. When the Ungapped (but * is replaced to - ) MSAs and Trees are provided the ProPIP will output the ⋋ & μ. This is done using lambda_mu_generator.m file. 

6. All ⋋ & μ generation steps are carried out in the directory /Documents/ProPIP/Params_Generation/
7. The outputs folder include all outs from the ⋋ & μ generation
