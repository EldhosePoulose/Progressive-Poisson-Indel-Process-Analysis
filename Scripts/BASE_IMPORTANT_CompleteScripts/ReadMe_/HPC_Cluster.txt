Dear all
 
Thank you again for attending our meeting today. Here is the link to the HPC User Wiki:

In addition, this link takes you directly to the "Get an account"  page:

As far as I see, we already have an account for pouloeld from the past, so no need to request a new one.
 
Kind regards,
 
Pascal
